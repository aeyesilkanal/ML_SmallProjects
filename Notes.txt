Hi,

Bob and I are grading the labs starting with Lab 1 and Lab 2.  Please make sure
that you have a PDF or .docx file at the top level of each lab directory that explains what you did, and summarizes your results along the lines of the Labâ€™s instructions.

Some of you have just ipython notebooks without enough comments to figure out what
you were trying to do.  

Others have provided nicely formatted reports (Thank you!).
